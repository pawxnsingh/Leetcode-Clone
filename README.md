Frontend - React + ts + shadCN/radixUI
Backend - first i'll Develop every thing in firebase(v1) of the project
in the second version of this project will be using the express and node js and type script

Making frontend and backend is easy but, most difficult bit here is evaluation part that is the most difficult part and that is the moat of these sort of companies

backend and processes - is hard bit

quote of day : You should understand something more than fullstack.

moat : create a backend system pull problem from the messaging queue(RABITMQ/kafka) and run that code in the containerized fashion auto scales correctly if number of problem goes up lets say 20 problem a second
